# Genome-Analysis-1MB462-67615-VT2025

In this project for the Genome Analysis course, I'm aiming to reperform all the analysis done in the following paper:
Project 1 - Zhang, X., de Maat, V., Guzm√°n Prieto, A.M. et al. RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum. BMC Genomics 18, 893 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4299-9

All the details about the process of the project can be found under the wiki page.
